##HTML5 Geo Location Example (with Foursquare)

Just a test project of some HTML5 geo location and integration with the Foursquare API.

**Important:**

Register you app at [http://developer.foursquare.com](http://developer.foursquare.com) and note the client ID and the client secret.

Replace the two variables at the top of the location.js file (in the JS folder) with your client ID and client secret from Foursquare.

*Also included is a basic PHP proxy, this overcomes any cross domain problems but does mean that you need to use a PHP server to run this. I'm sure there are more elegant solutions out there.*
